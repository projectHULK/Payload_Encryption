In my C# project, I've implemented CSAT6 encryption to evade Windows Defender's detection mechanisms. The encrypted payload operates seamlessly in memory, enhancing its stealth and evasion capabilities. To achieve this, I've included the BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll library, which provides robust cryptographic functionalities for encryption and decryption processes. CSAT6's advanced encryption techniques further strengthen data protection, making it difficult for adversaries to intercept or manipulate the payload. By running entirely in memory, the project avoids leaving traces on disk, crucial for evading security scans.
